      <text>'''Rust''' is a [[multi-paradigm programming language]] designed for performance and safety, especially safe concurrency. Rust is syntactically similar to [[C++]], but can guarantee memory safety by using a borrow checker to validate references.

== History ==
Rust was originally designed by Graydon Hoare at Mozilla Research, with contributions from Dave Herman, Brendan Eich, and others. The designers refined the language while writing the Servo experimental browser engine.

== Features ==
Rust emphasizes zero-cost abstractions, move semantics, guaranteed memory safety, threads without data races, trait-based generics, pattern matching, type inference, minimal runtime, and efficient C bindings.

The language has gained significant adoption in systems programming, WebAssembly, and command-line tools. Major companies including Microsoft, Google, Amazon, and Meta use Rust in production systems.

== Memory Safety ==
Rust's ownership system enables memory safety without garbage collection. Each value in Rust has an owner, and there can only be one owner at a time. When the owner goes out of scope, the value is dropped.</text>

      <text>'''Machine learning''' ('''ML''') is a subset of [[artificial intelligence]] (AI) that provides systems the ability to automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed.

== Overview ==
Machine learning focuses on the development of computer programs that can access data and use it to learn for themselves. The process begins with observations or data, such as examples, direct experience, or instruction.

== Types of Machine Learning ==
Machine learning algorithms are typically classified into three categories:

=== Supervised Learning ===
The algorithm is trained on labeled data. The model learns to map inputs to known outputs. Common applications include spam detection, image classification, and price prediction.

=== Unsupervised Learning ===
The algorithm finds patterns in unlabeled data. Clustering and dimensionality reduction are common techniques. Applications include customer segmentation and anomaly detection.

=== Reinforcement Learning ===
The agent learns by interacting with an environment and receiving rewards or penalties. This approach is used in robotics, game playing, and autonomous vehicles.

== Applications ==
Machine learning has numerous applications including natural language processing, computer vision, recommendation systems, fraud detection, and medical diagnosis.</text>

      <text>A '''vector database''' is a type of [[database]] that indexes and stores [[vector embedding]]s for fast retrieval and similarity search. Vector databases are essential infrastructure for [[large language model]]s and [[semantic search]] applications.

== How Vector Databases Work ==
Vector databases store data as high-dimensional vectors, typically generated by machine learning models. When a query is made, the database finds vectors that are most similar to the query vector using distance metrics like cosine similarity or Euclidean distance.

== Common Distance Metrics ==
* '''Cosine similarity''': Measures the angle between two vectors
* '''Euclidean distance''': Measures the straight-line distance between points
* '''Dot product''': Measures alignment between vectors

== Popular Vector Databases ==
Several vector databases have gained popularity:
* Pinecone - Fully managed cloud vector database
* Milvus - Open source vector database for AI applications
* Weaviate - Vector search engine with GraphQL API
* Qdrant - Vector similarity search engine written in Rust
* Chroma - Embedding database for AI applications

== Use Cases ==
Vector databases power many AI applications including semantic search, recommendation systems, image similarity, question answering, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG).</text>

      <text>A '''distributed system''' is a system whose components are located on different networked computers, which communicate and coordinate their actions by passing messages to one another. The components interact with one another to achieve a common goal.

== Characteristics ==
Distributed systems have several key characteristics:
* '''Concurrency''': Components execute in parallel
* '''Lack of a global clock''': No single global notion of time
* '''Independent failures''': Components can fail independently

== CAP Theorem ==
The [[CAP theorem]] states that a distributed data store cannot simultaneously provide more than two of the following three guarantees:
* '''Consistency''': Every read receives the most recent write
* '''Availability''': Every request receives a response
* '''Partition tolerance''': The system continues to operate despite network partitions

== Consensus Algorithms ==
Consensus algorithms enable distributed systems to agree on values even when some nodes fail. Popular algorithms include:
* [[Paxos]] - Classic consensus algorithm
* [[Raft]] - Designed to be more understandable than Paxos
* [[PBFT]] - Byzantine fault tolerant consensus

== Applications ==
Distributed systems are used in cloud computing, blockchain networks, distributed databases, content delivery networks, and peer-to-peer file sharing systems.</text>

      <text>'''Semantic search''' refers to search techniques that aim to improve search accuracy by understanding the contextual meaning of terms within a searchable data space, as opposed to simple keyword matching.

== How It Works ==
Unlike traditional keyword search that matches exact terms, semantic search understands the intent and contextual meaning behind a query. This is typically achieved through:

=== Vector Embeddings ===
Text is converted into dense vector representations using neural network models. These embeddings capture semantic meaning, allowing similar concepts to have similar vector representations.

=== Hybrid Search ===
Many modern systems combine semantic search with traditional lexical search (like BM25) to get the best of both approaches. This hybrid approach uses techniques like Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF) to merge results.

== Benefits ==
* Better understanding of user intent
* Handles synonyms and related concepts
* Supports natural language queries
* More relevant results for ambiguous queries

== Applications ==
Semantic search is used in web search engines, enterprise search, e-commerce product search, legal document retrieval, medical literature search, and question-answering systems powered by large language models.</text>
